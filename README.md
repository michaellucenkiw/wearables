Outline
1. basic electronics
2. V=IR

<h2>Electronics Basics</h2>

V=IR 
Voltage = (resistance)(current)
Volts = ohms x amperage(amps)

Water pipe example
Potential = (pipe diameter)(force of water)

What is a Circuit? Basic loop of energy flow from (+) to Ground
Devices inside the circuit use energy to do work

<h2>Power</h2>
Common Voltages
AC alternating current/DC direct current
Most wall outlets in a home are 120V AC
Most devices DC
Transformer changes source V and A t
Look at phone power supply- Input/Output
Power Sources

Batteries
List V and capacity (Ah) amp hours

Anatomy of an Arduino 
5V - 5 volt power supply
3.3V - 3.3 volt power supply
Vin - input for electricity
GND - ground
A0 - analog read pin
D1 - Digital read/write
